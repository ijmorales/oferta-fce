Alternative view of the courses available for students of the FCE-UBA. Features include searching, filtering, pagination and comments.

## About
Bootstrapped in NextJS and fully designed my myself, including color palettes, logos and so. Tailwind has been used for the styling.
This project is intented to be built from the data at the data folder and served through a static CDN, at a cost of roughly $0.

## Data
The data has been scrapped from the web, although the courses showing in the live preview are fake. The scrapper script is available for students with proper credentials at [FCE Scrapper](https://github.com/ijmorales/fce-scrap/)
